	<h3>Bible Interpretations</h3>
<hr>
 <h3>How do we interpret the contents of the Holy Bible?</h3> <br />

<hr>
&nbsp &nbsp We can interpret the contents of the Holy Bible through meditation, whereby, we can expect God to inspire us to interpret the allegories, parables, spiritual symbols and metaphors couched in the contents of the Old Testament and the New Testament because although many of the events, therein, actually happened; however, there are many incidents that are actually allegories, parables, spiritual symbols and metaphors. In fact, it is obvious many of them are not actual incidents since many of them would not be able to be interpreted as actual facts. And the Book of Revelations exemplifies that fact; therefore, the book of Revelations reveals that all of its contents are a plethora of symbols, metaphors, and symbolic numbers.
Yes, there are many books that interpret the contents of the Holy Bible, including many video tutorials; however, we must be careful to scrutinize those interpretations. We scrutinize them by testing and comparing them with God’s inspirations since Truth is constant and anything that does not adhere to God’s Truth will eventually fall by the wayside and dissipate into nothingness. </p>
In many cases, interpreting the contents of the Holy Bible do not pass the testing and comparing of them according to God’s spiritual, inspirations of Truth; therefore, we must reject them as being valid interpretations.<br />

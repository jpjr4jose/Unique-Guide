	<h3>What is the Collective Consciousness?</h3>
<hr>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp<p> First of all it must be stated that  selfconscious(A.K.A. selfconsciousness) and subconscious(A.K.A. subconsciousness) do not exist; they are the figments of the imaginations of those who created them because they are not fully aware that true consciousness really exists as an invisible entity. That consciousness is a  collective consciousness,  whereby,  everyone can become fully aware of it by the process of intense meditation. Sometimes it may require several or even many meditations to experience the collective consciousness which we all possess. 
Selfconsciousness, which is supposedly an appendage or part of the  subconsciousness, is nothing more than the five senses, that are vibrating at tremendously high frequencies, and they are detecting matter which is also vibrating at tremendously high frequencies; therefore, the senses and matter are no more and no less exactly those high vibrating frequencies. In fact, everything in the universe, including our bodies and our thoughts, are both corpuscles and wavelengths of high frequencies.<br />
<hr>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Through meditation not only will we become aware of the Collective Consciousness, but also we will experience the many revelations that exist within our collective consciousness.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Therefore, It would behoove us to realize that selfconsciouness and subconsciousness do not exist, and we must reject them as  reality. Once we replace our recognition of the theories of, “selfconsciousness and subconciousness,” with the reality of collective consciousness we will become aware of its knowledge and its many esoteric aspects and spiritual revelations.
